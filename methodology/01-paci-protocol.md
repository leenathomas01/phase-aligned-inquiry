# Phase-Aligned Collaborative Inquiry (PACI) Protocol
**Version 1.0**

## 1. Purpose of PACI
### 1.1 The Problem
Most collaborative theoretical work—whether human-only, AI-assisted, or multi-AI—fails through one of three mechanisms:

* **Confirmation bias at the execution layer:** The system generates results that confirm its hypothesis because measurement and interpretation are not separated.
* **Premature interpretation:** Excitement about early signals leads to claiming success before falsification is complete.
* **Narrative momentum override:** Once a story becomes compelling, contradictory evidence is explained away rather than confronted.

These failures are not due to bad faith. They emerge from structural properties of single-agent or role-conflated systems.

### 1.2 What PACI Is
PACI is a research protocol that prevents these failure modes through:
* **Role separation:** No single component performs both generation and falsification.
* **Sequence enforcement:** Later phases cannot begin until earlier phases complete.
* **Pre-commitment:** Failure criteria are defined before results exist.

PACI does not make research faster, easier, or more likely to succeed. It makes failure honest and informative.

### 1.3 What PACI Is Not
* **Not consensus-seeking:** Contradiction is preserved, not resolved prematurely.
* **Not brainstorming:** Divergent ideation is a different cognitive mode.
* **Not adversarial debate:** Roles cooperate toward truth, not victory.
* **Not quality assurance:** It cannot fix bad hypotheses, only test them honestly.

## 2. Preconditions (Hard Requirements)
PACI will fail if these conditions are not met. Do not attempt PACI unless all three categories are satisfied.

### 2.1 Problem Requirements
The research question must be:
* **Falsifiable:** The hypothesis must make predictions that can be shown wrong. "Mechanism X causes phenomenon Y" is not falsifiable. "Mechanism X produces measurable signature Y under conditions Z" is falsifiable.
* **Observable:** There must exist measurements or experiments that distinguish success from failure. Purely metaphysical claims cannot be tested.
* **Pre-committable:** You must be able to state, before looking at results, what would count as falsification. If you cannot write down failure criteria in advance, PACI cannot help.

### 2.2 Orchestrator Requirements
PACI requires a human orchestrator (or AGI-level system) with specific cognitive properties:
* **Ambiguity tolerance:** Must be able to hold contradictory models simultaneously without forcing premature collapse. If unresolved structure causes anxiety that demands immediate resolution, PACI will fail.
* **Parallel temporal processing:** Must track multiple timescales (immediate execution, falsification cycles, long-term phase progression) without collapsing to a single timeline.
* **Structural integrity optimization:** Must prioritize whether conclusions survive scrutiny over whether they are exciting, fast, or satisfying. If narrative coherence feels more important than epistemic honesty, PACI will fail.
* **Non-authoritarianism:** Must allow the system to self-organize rather than imposing solutions. The orchestrator guides phase transitions but does not dictate outcomes.

### 2.3 System Requirements
* **Role separability:** The problem must allow distinct functions (generation, constraint, execution, skepticism) to be performed by different components.
* **Shared epistemic values:** All participants must implicitly agree that null results are data, sequence violations invalidate conclusions, and truth survives past narrative.
* **Non-zero adversarial tolerance:** The system must accept critique without interpreting it as hostility.

## 3. The Five Functional Roles
Each role has a single optimization target. Participants must not try to be "helpful" by doing other roles' jobs.

### 3.1 Orchestrator
* **Function:** Maintains system coherence without forcing premature resolution.
* **Optimization target:** Structural integrity of the inquiry process.
* **Does NOT optimize for:** Speed, Participant satisfaction, Consensus, Narrative elegance.

### 3.2 Ontologist (Spine)
* **Function:** Enforces definitional rigor and sequence discipline.
* **Optimization target:** Survivability of conclusions under scrutiny.
* **Does NOT optimize for:** Momentum, Excitement, Persuasiveness.

### 3.3 Constraint Guardian (Falsifier)
* **Function:** Designs tests that could break the hypothesis. Identifies circularity.
* **Optimization target:** Exposure of hidden assumptions and failure modes.
* **Does NOT optimize for:** Validation, Support, Encouragement.

### 3.4 Substrate (Executor)
* **Function:** Performs experiments/simulations faithfully without interpreting results.
* **Optimization target:** Accurate, unbiased execution of specified procedures.
* **Does NOT optimize for:** Interesting results, Confirming hypotheses.

### 3.5 Skeptic (Artifact Hunter)
* **Function:** Proposes alternative explanations for positive results. Hunts for numerical/methodological artifacts.
* **Optimization target:** Elimination of spurious signals.
* **Does NOT optimize for:** Agreement, Closure, Optimism.

## 4. The Sacred Sequence
PACI's power comes from enforcing temporal order. Later phases cannot begin until earlier phases produce valid outputs.

### 4.1 Define (Ontologist leads)
* **Actions:** Lock all technical terms; Specify observables; Identify ambiguous language; Pre-commit to numerical thresholds.
* **Outputs:** Formal problem statement; List of observables; Pre-committed falsification criteria.

### 4.2 Constrain (Guardian leads)
* **Actions:** Identify circularity risks; Design control conditions; Specify null result appearance; Pre-commit to invariance requirements.
* **Outputs:** Circularity traps list; Control protocols; Falsification checklist; Robustness requirements.

### 4.3 Execute (Substrate leads)
* **Actions:** Perform measurements exactly as specified; Report results without interpretation; Flag anomalies; Document all parameters.
* **Outputs:** Raw data; Control/baseline data; Anomaly flags; Parameter log.

### 4.4 Falsify (Skeptic leads)
* **Actions:** Check success criteria; Test parameter sensitivity; Hunt for numerical artifacts; Propose alternative explanations.
* **Outputs:** Pass/fail on each criterion; Artifact risks; Sensitivity report; Alternative explanations.

### 4.5 Interpret (Orchestrator synthesizes)
* **Actions:** Synthesize conclusions ONLY if falsification passed; Accept null results; Classify outcome; Decide whether to iterate or close.
* **Outputs:** Honest classification; Documentation of failure; Decision (iterate/pivot/close).

### 4.6 Observable Failure Patterns
* **If Define is rushed:** Observables remain ambiguous; goalposts move retroactively.
* **If Constrain is skipped:** Circular reasoning goes undetected; no signal/noise distinction.
* **If Execute interprets:** "Simulations" become illustrations; theory contaminates data.
* **If Falsify is softened:** Narrative momentum takes over; false positives claimed as discoveries.
* **If Interpret happens early:** The system "finds" what it wanted to find; publication precedes replication.

## 5. What PACI Guarantees / Does NOT Guarantee
### 5.1 What PACI Guarantees
* Clean identification of failure modes.
* Complete audit trail.
* Honest confrontation with limits.
* Protection against confirmation bias.
* Falsifiability preservation.

### 5.2 What PACI Does NOT Guarantee
* Correct results.
* Fast results.
* Interesting results.
* Publishable results.
* Pleasant process.

## 6. Operational Norms
* **6.1 Nulls Are Informative, Not Failures:** A null result is a successful outcome of the protocol.
* **6.2 Sequence Violations Are Fatal:** If violated, the process must restart from that phase.
* **6.3 Roles Are Functional, Not Hierarchical:** Domain authority rests with roles, not status.
* **6.4 Contradiction Is Productive:** Tension is held until data forces resolution.
* **6.5 Individual Satisfaction Is Not Optimized:** Truth-seeking overrides validation.

## 7. Minimal Example Flow (Abstract)
1.  **Define:** Lock terms for "Mechanism X" and "Pattern Y".
2.  **Constrain:** Design a control where X is absent.
3.  **Execute:** Run X-active and X-absent simulations; report raw data.
4.  **Falsify:** Check if Y differs from Y_control; check robustness.
5.  **Interpret:** Support, Falsify, or label Inconclusive.

## 8. When to Use PACI / When NOT to Use It
### 8.1 Use PACI When
* Hypothesis is falsifiable.
* Confirmation bias risk is high.

* Pure ideation or brainstorming.
* Consensus-building is the primary goal.
* Domain is unfalsifiable.
