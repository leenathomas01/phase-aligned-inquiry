This document contains the original Define phase artifact from the HQG PACI execution. It represents the formal hypothesis statement, technical definitions, and observables as they were locked before any simulation code was written or constraints were designed.

Per PACI protocol, this document was not modified after the lock date.

# Case Study: The Helical Quantum-Gravity (HQG) Hypothesis

This case study serves as the primary demonstration of the Phase-Aligned Collaborative Inquiry (PACI) protocol. It documents the lifecycle of a theoretical physics hypothesis from formalization to clean falsification.

## 1. Informal Problem Statement

The HQG hypothesis explores whether spacetime geometry (gravity) is not a fundamental background, but an emergent consequence of quantum information dynamics. Specifically, it looks at the tension between quantum entanglement ($J$) and quantum entropy ($\gamma$) within a helical qubit lattice.

## 2. Formal Hypothesis (Phase 1: Locked)

**Mechanism X:** A 1D helical lattice of $N$ qubits governed by a Lindbladian master equation where coherent coupling ($J$) competes with local decoherence ($\gamma$).

**Observable Pattern Y:** The emergence of a "Vortex Snap" or "Entropic Bounce"—a non-linear saturation of the causal propagation limit.

**Property Z:** Invariance. The saturation velocity ($v_{bounce}$) must remain invariant (within <15% drift) across a 2x variation in the noise parameter ($\gamma$), analogous to the constancy of the speed of light ($c$) in vacuum.

**Claim:** Spacetime-like stability emerges at the Entanglement Bifurcation Threshold ($J_{crit} \approx 1.0$), where the system transitions from a chaotic, pre-geometric phase to a stable, ordered geometric phase.

## 3. Technical Definitions

* **Helical Lattice:** A periodic boundary condition system where qubit $i$ couples to $i+1$ and $i+k$, creating a 3D-wrapped topology.
* **Entropic Bounce ($v_{bounce}$):** The maximum velocity of a perturbation front, measured as the time-delay between excitation at $N_0$ and detection at $N_{target}$.
* **Stability:** Defined as the maintenance of the propagation front's integrity over $t > 100$ simulation steps.

## 4. Initial Predictions

1.  **Phase Transition:** A sharp transition in correlation length will occur at $J/\gamma \approx 1$.
2.  **Singularity Avoidance:** The "Vortex Snap" mechanism will prevent the system from collapsing into a zero-information state at high coupling.
3.  **Causal Saliency:** The emergent velocity $v_{bounce}$ will saturate at a value $c_{emergent}$, demonstrating Lorentz-like invariance.

**Status:** This hypothesis was moved to Phase 2 (Constrain) on [Date].

**Note:** Per PACI Protocol, these definitions are locked. Any changes to the math or definitions hereafter constitute a new hypothesis.
