# HQG Case Study: Reading Guide

This folder documents the complete lifecycle of a falsifiable physics hypothesis.

The files are numbered in chronological order. **Read them sequentially.**

## File Order and Purpose

**00-context.md** — What the hypothesis attempted and why this approach was used  
**01-define.md** — The locked hypothesis artifact (frozen before execution)  
**02-constrain.md** — The falsification plan (designed before any code ran)  
**03-execute.md** — What was actually run (no interpretation, no outcomes)  
**04-falsify.md** — Checklist application (mechanical, no defense)  
**05-interpret.md** — What the failure revealed (conceptual reclassification)  
**06-lessons-for-paci.md** — What the process revealed (forensic analysis)

## Why Sequential Reading Matters

Files 01–03 are time-locked artifacts. They contain no knowledge of later phases.

Reading them in order shows that constraints were set before results existed.

Reading them out of order removes the time context in which decisions were made.
