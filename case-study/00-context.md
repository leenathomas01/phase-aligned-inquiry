# HQG Case Study: Context

This case study documents PACI being applied to a falsifiable hypothesis from theoretical physics. The hypothesis was tested rigorously and cleanly falsified. The case study demonstrates how PACI functions when executed correctly under real epistemic pressure.

## The Informal Idea

The hypothesis originated from a question: Can the speed of light emerge as a derived constant from a discrete lattice model rather than being imposed as a fundamental parameter?

The proposed mechanism involved a discrete lattice model where two competing dynamics (coherence and noise) interacted. The details of this model are documented in the Define phase artifacts. Here, only the intent of the hypothesis is relevant.

The informal claim: At a critical threshold, the system would transition from disordered to ordered states. This threshold would represent an invariant causal limit—analogous to the speed of light in relativity—emerging from the competition between order and disorder.

If successful, this would demonstrate that a fundamental physical constant could arise from substrate dynamics rather than being axiomatic.

## Why This Was Falsifiable

The hypothesis made specific testable predictions:

**Prediction 1:** A sharp transition exists between chaotic and stable regimes at some critical coupling J_crit.  
**Prediction 2:** This critical threshold J_crit is invariant—it does not depend on the noise parameter γ within physically reasonable ranges.  
**Prediction 3:** Propagation properties above J_crit resemble relativistic causality (finite invariant speed limit).

These predictions were falsifiable because:

- The existence of a transition could be tested by measuring correlation propagation across parameter sweeps
- Invariance could be tested by varying γ and checking whether J_crit remained constant
- Specific numerical thresholds could be pre-committed (e.g., "invariance requires J_crit drift <15% across γ range")

A null result was well-defined: If no sharp transition existed, or if J_crit depended strongly on γ, the hypothesis would be falsified.

## Why PACI Was Appropriate

This hypothesis satisfied all PACI requirements:

- **Confirmation bias risk was high:** The hypothesis originated from theoretical motivation (emergent spacetime). The researcher had intellectual investment in the idea succeeding.
- **Falsifiability was clear:** Observable predictions existed with pre-committable failure criteria.
- **Role separation was possible:** Multiple AI agents could be assigned to Ontologist, Guardian, Substrate, and Skeptic roles. A human orchestrator could maintain phase discipline.
- **Resources were adequate:** Computational simulations could be run with sufficient parameter sweeps and controls.
- **Stakes justified overhead:** The claim, if validated, would be publishable. If falsified, the failure mode would inform theoretical understanding.

The hypothesis represented exactly the class of work PACI is designed for: a falsifiable structural claim where excitement about potential success creates risk of premature interpretation or unconscious parameter tuning.

## What This Case Study Documents

The following files document each phase of PACI execution:

- **Phase 1 (Define):** How observables were locked and success criteria were pre-committed
- **Phase 2 (Constrain):** How falsification tests were designed before execution
- **Phase 3 (Execute):** How simulations were run without interpretation
- **Phase 4 (Falsify):** How invariance testing revealed parameter dependence
- **Phase 5 (Interpret):** How the hypothesis was reclassified after clean falsification

The case study shows how PACI prevented premature celebration when early results looked promising, forced invariance testing before claims were made, and enabled honest acceptance when the hypothesis failed its pre-committed criteria.

The purpose of this case study is to show PACI under real conditions. The domain is incidental.
